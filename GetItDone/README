****KEEP IN MIND LIST****
- Keep working on Life-cycle stuff, releasing resources, saving info etc -


****TO DO LIST****
- Figure out why sorting the task list messes up the database saving -
	- needs to be done so tasks can be displayed by order of date
	
- Work on some UI fixes and start figuring out how to design the "Task done" process -
